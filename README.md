# AlarmMod
Welcome to AlarmMod: a tModloader mod filled with random ideas I've decided to add to the game, whether out of genuine belief that they would be good additions or out of sheer spite for existence itself.

It also introduces a new class called Link, which is based on linking yourself to another player to drastically increase their damage. There's much more to it than that, though; a variety of effects are at your disposal that let you help your friends, wreak havoc on your enemies, rapidly orbit around someone like some ridiculous human yo-yo while they are powerless to stop your antics, and more. Link is a fully-fledged class, with links (the Link equivalent of weapons), armor sets, and accessories spanning your first steps in the world all the way to the very end of the game.
